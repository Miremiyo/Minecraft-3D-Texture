### Minecraft 3D Texture Updates
This is a texture pack that I started developing as a hobby when I was in middle school. I will update it when I feel like it. This is being developed for the general public as well as NITIC servers.

# Update infomation
The update information for each version will be as follows
## 1.0
Create resource pack base<br>
Add all types of rails and ladder
## 1.1

No public release
## 1.2

Also, a bug in 1.1 has been fixed.<br>
lotus now has a color and adapts to each biome by adding a "tintindex".
